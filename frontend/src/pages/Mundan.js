                <h3>âœ… Doâ€™s (Things to Remember)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose the Right Muhurat:</strong>Consult an astrologer to choose the most auspicious time (Muhurat) for the Mundan ceremony. The right date and time ensure the alignment of celestial forces in the child's favor. For 2025, the Muhurat should be selected based on the childâ€™s birth details and favorable Tithi and Nakshatra. </li>
                    <li><strong>Perform the Ritual with Family Blessings:</strong> Family and elders should be present for the ceremony, as their blessings are considered important for the child's future. The presence of grandparents, uncles, and aunts helps in invoking positive energies.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cleanliness and Purity:</strong>Ensure that the ceremony is performed in a clean environment. Clean the area where the Mundan is to take place and maintain spiritual purity. A sacred place like a temple or a clean home can be chosen for the ceremony. </li>
                    <li><strong>Offer Prayers and Aarti:</strong>Before performing the Mundan, it is traditional to offer prayers and Aarti to Lord Ganesha or any other preferred deity to seek blessings. A small puja or havan can also be performed before the ceremony begins. </li>
                    <li><strong>Cut the Hair in Small Portions:</strong>It is customary to shave the childâ€™s head in small portions rather than all at once. This is believed to help in the gradual removal of negative influences and ensure the child's well-being.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use a New Razor or Scissors:</strong> Always use a new razor or scissors for the Mundan. This is considered auspicious and is believed to symbolize a fresh start for the child, free of past negative influences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Offer the Hair to a River or Sacred Place:</strong>After the hair is shaved, it should be disposed of properly. Traditionally, the hair is either thrown into a sacred river or kept in a clean place. The idea is that the removed hair should be taken far from the home to avoid attracting negative energies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ðŸš« Donâ€™ts (Things to Avoid)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Mundan During Inauspicious Times:</strong>Do not perform the Mundan ceremony on days when the planetary positions are unfavorable, such as when the moon is in malefic constellations or there is a negative planetary influence. Always consult an astrologer to avoid inauspicious times.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Do Not Cut All the Hair at Once:</strong>Avoid shaving the childâ€™s head completely in one go. Cutting hair in sections is considered auspicious and ensures that the childâ€™s energy is purified gradually.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Do Not Perform the Ceremony Alone:</strong>It is essential that the childâ€™s parents or elders participate in the ritual. Performing the Mundan without family involvement is not recommended as it is believed to weaken the spiritual energy of the event.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do Not Perform the Mundan on Certain Days:</strong>Certain Tithis like Chaturdashi, Amavasya, or Purnima (full moon day) are considered inauspicious for performing the Mundan. Similarly, avoid doing the ceremony during solar or lunar eclipses or when malefic planets like Saturn or Mars are adversely placed in the child's chart.</li>
                </ul>
